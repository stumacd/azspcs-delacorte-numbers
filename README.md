# Al Zimmerman's Programming Contest - Delacote Numbers

[Problem Description](http://www.azspcs.net/Contest/DelacorteNumbers)

My entry did well, it mainly needed further optimization on the Delacote number's delta. But I couldn't find a sweet spot between memory usage/ complexity/ and performance to really climb the ladder.
